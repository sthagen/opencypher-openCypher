= The Cypher Style Guide

toc::[]

This is the style guide for the Cypher language, in the context of its standardization through the openCypher project.
This document consists of two main sections: <<Rules>> and <<Recommendations>>.

In <<Rules>>, we list syntax guidelines for composing Cypher queries in a conventional, readability-oriented way.
The examples provided always transform _valid_, but poorly formatted, queries into a different query in the recommended format, whilst retaining the same semantics.

In <<Recommendations>>, we list guidelines that may have an effect on the semantics of queries, such as the way a graph schema is composed through label and relationship types.
Bear in mind that these recommendations will not work after-the-fact: if the graph has been constructed with one set of label and relationship types, queries in the associated workload cannot be re-formatted according to these recommendations without also refactoring the data graph.

== Why is style important?

Consider this dadaist work of art from Nigel Small and Nicole White:

.Insane query
[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (null)-[:merge]->(true)
with null.delete as foreach, `true`.false as null
return 2 + foreach, coalesce(null, 3.1415)
limit 10;
----

Then compare it to this classical piece by Mark Needham:

.Sane query
[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (member:Member {name: 'Mark Needham'})
      -[:HAS_MEMBERSHIP]->()-[:OF_GROUP]->(:Group)-[:HAS_TOPIC]->(topic)
WITH member, topic, count(*) AS score
MATCH (topic)<-[:HAS_TOPIC]-(otherGroup:Group)
WHERE NOT (member)-[:HAS_MEMBERSHIP]->(:Membership)-[:OF_GROUP]->(otherGroup)
RETURN otherGroup.name, collect(topic.name), sum(score) AS score
ORDER BY score DESC
----

---

The purpose of this document is to help users of the language to share queries with each other with minimal friction, and to construct a consistent and portable usage of the language across many use cases and implementations.

== Rules

In case two rules are in conflict, and there is no explicit mention of which rule trumps, the rule mentioned last applies.

// Template:

.Bad
[source, cypher]
----

----

.. Put `ON CREATE` before `ON MATCH` if both are present.
// no example necessary

. Start a subquery on a new line after the opening brace, indented with two (additional) spaces.
Leave the closing brace on its own line.

== Recommendations

* When using Cypher language constructs in prose, use a monospaced font and follow the styling rules.
** When referring to labels and relationship types, the colon should be included as follows: `:Label`, `:REL_TYPE`.
** When referring to functions, use lower camel case and parentheses should be used as follows: `shortestPath()`. Arguments should normally not be included.
* If you are storing Cypher statements in a separate file, use the file extension `.cypher`.

=== Graph modelling
