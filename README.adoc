image:https://travis-ci.org/opencypher/openCypher.svg?branch=master["Build Status", link="https://travis-ci.org/opencypher/openCypher"]

This repository holds the specification of Cypher, a declarative property graph query language.
Its purpose is to be central to the process of evolving the specification and standardisation of Cypher as a graph query language.

== Overview of the process

Changes to openCypher are made through consensus in the openCypher Implementers Group (oCIG).
The process for proposing changes, voting on proposals and measuring consensus is described in https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1OHMxiz9xW6rINiJcCdm28a8uNcZEtCsMPfhFSIA-XXE/edit[this set of slides].

Refer to the link:CIP-PROCESS.adoc[Cypher Improvement Process] document for more details on CIPs, CIRs, their structure and lifecycle.
